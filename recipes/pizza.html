        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>
            What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of course!
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a brilliant idea as my father had just received a baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza.
        </p>

        <p>
            I told him if he helped me make it I would talk about him on my website and he would be famous. That seemed to get his attention. He thought the dough was "slimy and gross" but he loved picking his own toppings, and the finished product was "awesome".
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of pizza dough</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup of shredded mozarella cheese</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, etc)</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/2 c warm water. Let it stand for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now add the 4 3/4 c flour, oil, salt and the 1 1/2 c water into the yeast mixture.</li>
            <li>Coat a bowl with 1 tbsp of olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl and turn over to coat all sides.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl and then place in an oven that just has the oven light turned on for 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
